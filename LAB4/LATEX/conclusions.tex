\justify
In this assignment we learnt how to analyze a more complex algorithm and parallelize it, with an extra problem that we hadn't found on the previous labs; the problem with memory copying and the usage of \textit{alloca} function. We also learnt how to re-use the cut-off script from the previous lab and adapt it to the current problem.

Another issue that we could observe very clearly in this assignment is the importance of a good cut-off mechanism, as the execution time of the parallel version increased the time compared to the serial one but greatly improved when using an optimum cut-off value.
